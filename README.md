# sms_spam_detection
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to detect spam messages in SMS text data. The dataset consists of labeled messages marked as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam), and the project uses text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques to accurately identify spam.
